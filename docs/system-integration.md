# MAria2 Cross-Platform System Integration

## Overview

MAria2 provides comprehensive cross-platform system integration through advanced, platform-aware managers that ensure consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## System Integration Managers

### Security Management

#### Features
- Cross-platform administrator and elevation checks
- Secure password hashing and token generation
- Granular file permission management
- Platform-specific security operations

#### Supported Platforms
- Windows: Uses Windows API for security checks
- macOS: Utilizes Unix-based permission system
- Linux: Implements standard Linux security mechanisms

#### Key Methods
- `IsAdministrator()`: Detect user privilege level
- `HashPassword(string password)`: Secure password hashing
- `SetFilePermissions(string filePath, FilePermissionLevel level)`: Manage file access rights

### Network Management

#### Features
- Comprehensive network information retrieval
- Internet connection testing
- Network interface and IP address detection
- Real-time network change monitoring
- Platform-specific network speed tracking

#### Supported Platforms
- Windows: Uses native Windows network APIs
- macOS: Leverages BSD socket and system commands
- Linux: Utilizes standard Linux network information interfaces

#### Key Methods
- `GetNetworkInfo()`: Retrieve detailed network status
- `TestInternetConnection()`: Check internet connectivity
- `GetActiveNetworkInterfaces()`: List active network connections
- `MonitorNetworkChanges(Action<NetworkChangeEvent>)`: Track network state changes

## Dependency Injection Integration

Managers are designed to be easily integrated via dependency injection:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ICrossPlatformSecurityManager>(
    CrossPlatformSecurityManagerFactory.Create(logger)
);

services.AddSingleton<ICrossPlatformNetworkManager>(
    CrossPlatformNetworkManagerFactory.Create(logger)
);
```

## Performance Considerations

- Lightweight, minimal overhead implementations
- Lazy initialization of platform-specific resources
- Efficient error handling and logging
- Minimal external dependencies

## Security Principles

- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure token generation
- Platform-specific permission management
- Comprehensive logging of security-related events

## Extensibility

The managers are designed with an abstract base class and platform-specific implementations, making it easy to:
- Add new platforms
- Extend existing functionality
- Override default behaviors

## Recommended Usage

1. Always use factory methods for instantiation
2. Handle potential platform-specific exceptions
3. Log and monitor system integration events
4. Respect platform-specific security constraints

## Limitations

- Requires .NET 8 runtime
- Some advanced features may have platform-specific restrictions
- Performance may vary slightly between platforms

## Future Roadmap

- Enhanced machine learning-driven network optimization
- More granular system resource management
- Expanded platform support
- Improved cross-platform UI integration

## Troubleshooting

- Check system logs for detailed error information
- Verify .NET runtime and platform compatibility
- Ensure appropriate permissions are set

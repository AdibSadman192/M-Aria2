# MAria2 Security Architecture

## 🔒 Security Design Principles

MAria2 implements a comprehensive, cross-platform security strategy focusing on:
- Platform-aware security mechanisms
- Minimal attack surface
- Transparent security operations
- Adaptive threat mitigation

## 🌐 Cross-Platform Security Management

### Platform-Specific Security Abstractions
- Windows: Native Windows security APIs
- macOS: BSD/Unix security mechanisms
- Linux: Standard Linux security interfaces

### Key Security Features
- Administrator privilege detection
- Secure credential management
- File permission controls
- Runtime environment validation

## 🔐 Authentication and Authorization

### Password Management
- Secure hashing using SHA-256
- Salted password generation
- Token-based authentication
- Configurable password complexity

### Privilege Management
- Cross-platform elevation checks
- Granular permission systems
- Secure process spawning
- Runtime permission validation

## 🛡️ Network Security

### Secure Network Operations
- Encrypted communication channels
- Connection integrity verification
- Dynamic firewall interaction
- Network change monitoring

### IP and Connection Security
- Public IP detection
- Network interface validation
- Adaptive connection strategies
- Intelligent routing

## 🚨 Threat Detection

### Security Monitoring
- Suspicious activity logging
- Runtime anomaly detection
- Performance-based security triggers
- Machine learning threat prediction

## 🔍 Implementation Example

```csharp
// Cross-platform security manager instantiation
var securityManager = CrossPlatformSecurityManagerFactory.Create(logger);

// Check administrator privileges
bool isAdmin = securityManager.IsAdministrator();

// Secure file permission management
securityManager.SetFilePermissions(
    filePath, 
    FilePermissionLevel.ReadWrite
);
```

## 🛠️ Configuration Options

Security behaviors can be configured through:
- Dependency injection
- Configuration files
- Runtime parameters

## 🔬 Continuous Improvement

Our security architecture is:
- Regularly audited
- Continuously updated
- Community-reviewed
- Transparent in implementation

## 📋 Compliance

MAria2 aims to meet or exceed:
- OWASP security guidelines
- Platform-specific security standards
- Best practices in secure software design

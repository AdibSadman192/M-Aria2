# MAria2 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) setup for the MAria2 Download Manager.

## CI/CD Components
- GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration
- Docker for Containerization
- Prometheus for Monitoring
- Grafana for Dashboarding

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Build and Test
- Runs on every push and pull request
- Builds the entire solution
- Runs unit and integration tests
- Generates code coverage report

### 2. Security Scanning
- Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Performs static code analysis
- Checks for potential security issues

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
- Runs performance benchmarks
- Tracks performance metrics
- Identifies potential bottlenecks

### 4. Docker Build
- Builds Docker image
- Runs tests inside container
- Ensures containerization compatibility

### 5. Release Drafting
- Automatically drafts releases
- Generates changelog
- Prepares for manual review

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Prometheus collects application metrics
- Grafana provides visualization
- Alerts configured for:
  - High CPU Usage
  - Low Memory
  - Download Failure Rates
  - Service Availability
  - Disk Space

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub Account
- Docker
- .NET 8 SDK

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Docker
3. Run `docker-compose up --build`

### Monitoring Access
- Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration
- Modify `.github/workflows/dotnet-ci.yml` for workflow customization
- Update `prometheus.yml` for metric collection
- Adjust `alert_rules.yml` for custom alerting

## Best Practices
- Always run tests locally before pushing
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor performance metrics
- Review security scan results

## Troubleshooting
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Inspect Docker container logs
- Review Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
